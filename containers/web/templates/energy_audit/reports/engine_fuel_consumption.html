    <p>
       Diesel engines are commonly used on Alaskan fishing vessels for propulsion, auxiliary AC, or hydraulic power
        generation. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is a measure of the efficiency of an engine. BSFC defines
        the amount of fuel required to produce a specified amount of work.  All engines require some energy to
        overcome internal friction and compression forces.  At light loads (less than 20%-30% of the engines rated
        HP) diesel engines have a higher BSFC (lowered efficiency) because the energy needed to overcome internal
        forces in the engine represents a higher percentage of the total load.  As the load increases, BSFC is
        reduced and engine efficiency improves rapidly, reaching peak efficiency between 50 and 80% of the
        continuous load rating.

                    At light loads, diesel engines use more fuel per horse power produced. Where possible, “right
                    size” the engine for the average load.
