    <p>
        Hydraulic loads can be highly variable depending on the type of deck equipment used, the condition of the
        hydraulic pumps and motors, and the amount of heat the system generates when circulating hydraulic fluid.
        Hydraulically powered refrigeration systems are addressed in the refrigeration section. Field tests show that
        line loss (energy needed to circulate the oil through the lines ) can account for a significant fraction of
        the hydraulic load.

                    <strong>Filter oil - </strong>Contaminant in hydraulic systems is widely recognized as the most
                    frequent cause of hydraulic equipment wear and failure. Worn pumps and motors are less efficient
                    and generate heat.  Pre-season run the hydraulic system at the dock with a 2 micron fine  filter
                    installed. After a few hours, change the filter to a 10 micron water absorbing filter for the
                    fishing season.

                    fittings. Replace worn pumps and motors. Heat and noise are signs of reduced efficiency.

                    <strong>Maintain proper oil viscosity - </strong> Operate ISO 32 oil around 100 degrees F and ISO
                    46 around 120 degrees F. Oil viscosity that is too low allows excessive fluids to slip past seals
                    and can fail to provide adequate lubrication between components. Oil viscosity that is too high
                    unnecessarily increases resistance to flow and may not reach between components with small
                    clearances in order to lubricate them.
