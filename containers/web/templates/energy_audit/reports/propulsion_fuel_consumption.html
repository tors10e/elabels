    <p>
        The amount of power needed to move a vessel through the water increases with speed. At low speeds, water
        friction and turbulence are the main sources of resistance.  However, as speed increases, wave-making
        resistance associated with the bow and stern waves exponentially increase until hull speed is reached. Figure
        1 shows how fuel consumption per nautical mile is nearly constant at low speeds, then increases rapidly as
        the vessel approaches its hull speed.
