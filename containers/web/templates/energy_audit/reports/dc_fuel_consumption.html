    <p>
        DC electric power is commonly used for navigation equipment and cabin lighting on Alaskan fishing vessels.
        Though typically small in comparison to the other loads on a fishing vessel, DC power is not free. DC
        alternator efficiency ranged from 30 to 70% depending on alternator speed, output and belt tension among
        other factors. At an alternator efficiency of 50%, a round trip battery charge/discharge efficiency
        of 80%, and a fuel price of $3/gallon, DC electricity on a fishing vessel costs approximately 60 cents/kWh in
        fuel. The figure below shows a contour plot of alternator efficiency distributed by manufacturer Delco-Remy Inc
        (reproduced from "Improving Alternator Efficiency Measurably Reduces Fuel Cost" by Mike Bradfield).
