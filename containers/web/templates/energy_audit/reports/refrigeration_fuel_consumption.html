    <p>
        There are many types of refrigeration systems used on Alaskan fishing vesselsâ€”from hydraulically driven plate
        freeze systems to AC powered blast freeze and RSW systems. Hold conditions also vary widely between vessels.
        Many of the vessels surveyed can reduce refrigeration fuel consumption by up to 15% and improve refrigeration
        capacity by simply opening their condenser water flow valve to reduce the discharge pressure.

                    <strong>Reduce compressor discharge pressure - </strong>Discharge pressure can be regulated by
                    the  amount of water moving through the condenser.  Lowering the discharge pressure can
                    significantly reduce energy consumption and increase system capacity.  Check with your
                    refrigeration  technician to evaluate the minimum discharge pressure needed for your application.

                    hydraulically,  or mechanically using a direct drive.  Field tests established that hydraulic
                    powered refrigeration systems can be 50% less efficient than electrically powered systems.

                    <strong>Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) - </strong>VFDs speed up or slow down electric motors by
                    regulating the frequency (hz) of the power supply.  VFDs can use the suction pressure to
                    automatically adjust compressor RPM to meet demand.  Field tests indicated that installing a VFD
                    on  a blast freeze system and increasing condenser flow can reduce freezer system fuel
                    consumption by 20%.

                    temperatute equates to about two additional gallons of fuel. If you can, purchase ice at the dock
                    to eliminate pull down fuel consumption.
