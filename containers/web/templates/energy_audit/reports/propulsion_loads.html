<p>
The figure  below shows the propulsion load estimates for the FV {{vessel_name}} based on energy audits of similar
vessels and information you provided. The amount of power needed to move a vessel through the water increases
exponentially with speed. At low speeds, water friction and turbulence are the main sources of resistance.  However, as
speed increases, wave-making resistance associated with the bow and stern waves increase exponentially until hull speed
is reached.

            <strong>Install a fuel flow meter</strong> - A fuel flow meter provides the information needed to adjust speed and optimize
        fuel efficiency in real time based on weather and sea conditions.

        <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Adjust your autopilot</strong> - Ensure your autopilot is tuned to minimize yaw and steer the straightest course possible.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Plan the route and timing</strong> - Take advantage of tides, currents, and predicted winds to save fuel.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Reduce drag</strong> - Keep the hull clean by removing marine growth regularly.  Minimize underwater appendages.
        Polish the propeller when hauled out.  Proper hull and propeller maintenance can reduce propulsion costs by
        10 to 20% at transit speeds.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Use paravane stabilizers only when necessary</strong> - paravane stabilizers can increase propulsion costs by 60%
        at transit speeds.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Reduce vessel weight</strong> - Loaded or tanked configurations increase fuel consumption at transit speeds by 30%.
