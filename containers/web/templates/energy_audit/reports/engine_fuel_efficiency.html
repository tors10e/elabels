<p>
    The figure  below shows the propulsion load estimates for the FV {{vessel_name}} based on energy audits of similar vessels
and information you provided. The amount of power needed to move a vessel through the water increases exponentially with
speed. At low speeds, water friction and turbulence are the main sources of resistance.  However, as speed increases,
wave-making resistance associated with the bow and stern waves increase exponentially until hull speed is reached.

            Check Exhaust—Exhaust from a well maintained diesel engine is almost invisible.  Light blue or white exhaust
            can be a sign of unburned fuel and reduced engine efficiency.

            “Right size” propulsion and auxiliary engines.—Bigger is not always better.  When re-powering, select an engine
            which runs efficiently at the average and maximum HP loads of your operation.

            Take advantage of modern diesel  engine technologies—Manufacturers’ data on 20 common diesel engines show
            significant BSFC differences between two-stroke, four-stroke and modern electronically-governed diesel engines.
