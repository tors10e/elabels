    <p>
        AC electric power is commonly used for lighting and hotel loads on Alaskan fishing vessels.  The fuel used to
        generate AC electricity on a vessel represents 95% of the life-cycle costs of electric motors and lighting
        equipment. AC powered refrigeration systems are addressed in the refrigeration section. Electricity on a boat
        is expensive, particularly when the genset is lightly loaded. The figure below shows the fuel cost measured
        on a typical fishing vessel genset under lightly loaded and fully loaded conditions. The figure assumes a
        fuel price of $3/gallon and allows comparison with electric rates in two Alaskan fishing towns.

                    a genset.  A true sine wave inverter is more efficient than a modified sine wave inverter.
