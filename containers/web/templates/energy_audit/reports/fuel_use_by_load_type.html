        The fuel consumption values were estimated based on the information you provided and trends observed in
        energy  audits of similar vessels.  The “engine” load category represents the fuel needed to overcome the
        internal forces of the engine and produces no useful work.  Additional information and simple steps to save
        fuel for each load category are provided below.
