    <p>
        The fuel consumption rate of most diesel engines can be approximated well as a linear function of the engine load over a
        broad range of operating conditions. The slope and y-intercept of the curves for engines on board FV Myriad were
        estimated based on the engines rated capacity and application (propulsion or auxiliary) that you provided, and data
        collected from similar engines in the fishing fleet. The engine condition, type of governor (electronic or mechanical),
        aspiration method and other factors also effect the curve of engines in practice, but those factors are not included in
        the model. Nonetheless, the model is accurate to within 10% of measured fuel consumption in 70% of the sea trials
        conducted for this study.

    <p>
        Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is the ratio of fuel consumption to useful energy output (gallons/kWh).
        The BSFC of the engine can be calculated based on the fuel consumption model. The lower the BSFC, the more efficient
        the engine. Figure 1 below shows the BSFC curve used to model FV Myriad. A few fundamental principles define the main
        features of the curve. Since the engine consumes some fuel even if it is performing no useful work, the BSFC increases
        rapidly at low loads. As the engine approaches its rated capacity, the BSFC approaches its minimum value. If the engine
        is overloaded, the BSFC increases, but that effect is not captured by the linear model used here because fishing vessel
        engines are rarely overloaded.
